# StyleTransfer_VGG19
This project implements a neural style transfer algorithm using PyTorch, allowing you to merge the content of one image with the style of another. The model is based on the VGG19 architecture from Torchvision.

we have a content image
![content](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379f54d5-cb55-42ad-b8ae-0fe206597495)

and apply a desired style
![style](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50386580-f0e3-43ec-a21d-cfbf8581c9e9)

and get a combination from both of the material
